FenixEdu Learning provides the public course and degree pages where the teachers publish information for their students.

The Learning consumes information that is stored in FenixEdu Academic and presents that information using the FenixEdu CMS.

It provides two [System Builders](): ExecutionCourseSiteBuilder and DegreeSiteBuilder.

The ExecutionCourseSiteBuilder initializes a site for an Execution Course with the following pages and settings:

+ A privileged menu that contain all the pages used to show information provided by Academic (groups, evaluation, announcements, planning, bibliography, etc.)
+ A second non-privileged menu "Extra pages"
+ A single Teacher Role, that is also the default for these sites, with all the teachers that have permissions to edit pages and announcements on Academic
+ The Teacher Role has no permission to edit privileged menus.

As a result all ExecutionCourse Sites have the same page structure with content provided by the Academic, followed by any pages that the course teachers want.



FenixEdu Learning also provides the necessary Components and a FenixEdu Learning Theme to display the Academic provided information.
